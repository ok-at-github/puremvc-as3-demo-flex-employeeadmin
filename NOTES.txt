Controllers:
-AddRoleResultCommand: Replace mx.Alert by Notification
-PrepViewCommmand: Disconnect Mediators until views are in place

Proxys:
-Replace ArrayCollection by ArrayList

VOs:
- Replace ArrayCollection by ArrayList
  (If auto import doesn't work, just show that autocompletion works import org.apache...)

Mediators:
- Deactivate event registration until FlexJS UIs are in place.
- Repalce import flash.events.Event by org.apache....events.Event;

Things to do:
- Disconnect the view(s) by replacing classic Flex files by FlexJS one and disabling the mediators
 (Copy classic view files to *Classic.mxml)
- Implement startup mechanism of PureMVC
- Try to compile the first time!!! (We expect some bugs!)
- - Enum issue: enum is a reserved JS term -> rename it!
- Should compile sucessfully now!


- Add additional compiler options that are needed for mdl
- Add mdl html template




General hints:
- Use and show "CTRL+F2" feature
- If using multicore don't forget to overwrite the constructor for ApplicationFacade
